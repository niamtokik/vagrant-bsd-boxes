# Automatic Installation

## OpenBSD Way

## Remote Control

All installer should have a way to be remotely controlled by
default. This solution must use standard available service, or a
simple way to communicate with. The authentication process is probably
the most complex part, and we will define it later.

## Rendez-vous Point

In some case, all information are defined somewhere and we don't need
remote control. This is generally called unattended installation. In
our case, to automatically install and deploy BSD image, we will
probably need a Rendez-vous Point based on standard protocols.
